# Subreddit Scraper

Simple script to scrape a subreddit's new rss and find regex-matched content.
Originally designed to scrape game keys for closed betas and whatnot.
If the config's regex is matched in a new post's content, the bot will scrape the keys and put them
into a file designated by the config and then open the file for the user.

Just wish I was better with tkinter so this would look better.
